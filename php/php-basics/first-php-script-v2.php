	•	To load a php web page you must open it through the web server – type the address into the web browser address bar.
•	PHP web pages use a .php file extension not .html
•	Use whitespace and comments to make your code easier to read and manage – especially for coursework code.
•	Comments in HTML and PHP use different notation, make sure you use the correct method when commenting code.
•	Don’t forget to end every PHP statement with a semi-colon (;).
